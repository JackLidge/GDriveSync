## Sync local folder with your Google Drive

This program syncs all local folder (pathnames) in `folder_sync_registrer.txt` to their matching Goolge folder ID. Each local pathname must have a Google folder ID to sync to. Pathname and Google folder ID can also be hard coded into the `Upload()` function. 


### Run the program
Run `upload.py`
